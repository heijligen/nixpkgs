      SVT VP9 encoder. Scalable Video Technology (SVT) is a software-based
      video coding technology that is highly optimized for Intel速 Xeon速 processors.
      Using the open source SVT-VP9 encoder, it is possible to spread video
      encoding processing across multiple Intel速 Xeon速 processors to achieve
      a real advantage of processing efficiency.
